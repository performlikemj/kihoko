# Kihoko Mobile App

This directory contains a React Native application that showcases Kihoko's art portfolio.

The app is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and React Navigation. It provides two main screens:

- **PortfolioScreen**: displays a grid of projects and artwork.
- **ArtDetailScreen**: shows a single piece of art with swipe navigation between images.

## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the development server with `npm start`.
3. Use the Expo app on your device or an emulator to preview.

This project uses modern animations via `react-native-reanimated` and smooth transitions with `react-navigation`.
